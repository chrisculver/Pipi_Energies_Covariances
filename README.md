# Readme

This directory contains the energies and covariance for all 6 ensembles used by the GWU lattice
QCD group.  Each ensemble has its own file.  The first line in each file is organized as follow,

m_pi  f_pi  E(I=0)   E(I=1)   E(I=2) 

Below this line is the covariance matrix.  Note that the number of energies extracted varies from
ensemble to ensemble.  The number of energies in each ensemble is


| Ensemble | I=0 | I=1 | I=2 |
|:--------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2448     |  5  |  6  |  4  |
| 3048     |  5  |  6  |  6  |
| 4848     |  6  |  8  |  10 |
| 2464     |  5  |  6  |  2  |
| 2864     |  5  |  6  |  3  |
| 3264     |  6  |  7  |  3  |
